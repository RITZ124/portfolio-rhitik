 - PROJECTS
 1. Self-Correcting RAG System
 Implemented ingestion, chunking, and FAISS vector search for fast retrieval.
 Added multi-layer guardrails (TF-IDF, LLM relevance, no-answer detection).
 Built a self-correcting pipeline to reduce hallucinations.
 Developed FastAPI backend with JWT auth + metrics; React frontend with NDJSON streaming.
 2. MedInsight-LLM (Clinical AI System)
 Built medical NER + severity classifier using BioClinicalBERT.
 Integrated GPT-based summaries with safety guardrails.
 Delivered PDF report generation, triage scoring, and red-flag detection via FastAPI.
 Created an interactive React dashboard for real-time clinical analysis.
 3. RL-Based Derivative Hedging System
 Designed RL (PPO) agent to hedge European options in stochastic markets.
  a custom Gymnasium environment with GBM dynamics & transaction costs.
 Achieved ~80% reduction in hedging error compared to delta hedging.
 Developed FastAPI backend + React UI for real-time visualization.
